# Whatâ€™s Streaming? Analyzing Netflix's Top Titles and Trends

## 1. Introduction

This project involves exploring and analyzing Netflix data using Power BI. The goal is to gain insights into the content available on Netflix, including trends in genres, IMDB/TMDB scores, countries releasing most content and more. Visualizations and reports are created to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## 3. Loading Data

Source of data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies/data)

In this project the loading was extremely easy, all that was needed was to upload the .csv-file to Power BI and check that the semantic model corresponded to what was in the original file.

## 4.  Results and Analysis

This project includes various visualizations to help understand the series and movies titles that are offered by Netflix to viewers.

The number of releases includes 5806 shows, both movies and shows. There were in total 107 countries were Netflix titles were produced. It's interesting that average IMDB scores are about 0.5-1.0 points higher for series than for movies. This could be due to the fact that Netflix puts more effort on producing high quality shows than movies. Or conversely, perhaps Netflix has not concentrated on getting the highest rated movies on their platform.

There are many lesser known shows among the highest rated content on Netflix: #ABtalks, Khawatir and Kota Factory are popular in their origin countries, but not so much in Wester Europe. Titles that I immediately recognized from the following bar charts were Breaking Bad, Wheel Of Fortune, Grey's Anatomy, Peaky Blinders and The Walking Dead.

Interestingly, there seems to be at least some level of correlation between the show duration and IMBD scores. Is this because longer shows tend to be produced with more resources/quality or that people just rank them higher because of the time invested?
